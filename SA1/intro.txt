Intro for Summative Assessment 1.

A company has three factories producing a product. Factory 1 produces of the product, factory 2 produces , and factory 3 produces , where . The defective rates of the products are , , and respectively, where . Write a program (user input for and ) to calculate the probability that a randomly selected product is defective.

    Note that your program should render prompt message to satisfy the following conditions:

or and
.
or  and

            .
    With your own computing experience, develop a front end to R that allows the user
        to input the values of a univariate discrete random variable and the associated probabilities and to obtain the mean and variance, and
        to input the values of a bivariate discrete random variable and the associated probabilities and to obtain the marginal and conditional distributions.

Your program should provide a facility to calculate the mean and variance of each distribution, and to plot the pdf and cdf. In each program, do validity checks that the probabilities are in the interval [0, 1], and that they sum to one.

  3. By generating 10,000 searches in R, carry out a simulation experiment for a search engine going through a list of sites for a given key phrase, until the key phrase is found. You should allow your program to input the probability p that any site will contain the key phrase.

        Plot the simulated pdf and calculate its mean and variance, and
        Obtain the simulated conditional distribution of searches when three searches have been carried out without success. Calculate its mean and variance, and satisfy yourself that they are equivalent to the simulated distribution of the complete set.

As test data assume each site has a 60% chance of containing the key phrase.
To satisfy yourself that the Markov memoryless property holds, obtain estimates of
(a)
and
(b) and
where X is the number of searches to the first success
